## Project Title
NexCart

## Project Overview
NexCart is a full-stack e-commerce platform that delivers a complete customer shopping journey and a dedicated admin operations console. The frontend is a React (Vite) single-page app and the backend is a Spring Boot REST API backed by MySQL. Authentication uses a **dual-cookie JWT system** — `authToken` for Customer sessions and `adminAuthToken` for Admin sessions — enabling concurrent logins without conflicts. Core flows include catalog browsing, cart management, checkout, payments, order tracking, returns, and customer support. The Admin can also rename the store from the Settings page, and the change propagates across the entire UI via the `useStoreName.js` hook.

## Problem Statement
Growing retail teams often juggle separate tools for catalog management, secure checkout, order lifecycle, and post-purchase support. That fragmentation leads to operational bottlenecks and inconsistent customer experiences.

## Solution Description
NexCart consolidates customer and admin workflows into a single platform. The customer app focuses on browsing, cart, checkout, and support. The admin console provides catalog management, order operations, customer management, coupon control, analytics, and system settings. A Spring Boot API enforces role-based access, secures sessions via dual-cookie JWT, and coordinates payments via Razorpay or COD.

```

## Dynamic Store Branding
Admin can rename the store from the Settings page. The `useStoreName.js` hook reads the name from `GET /api/settings` and distributes it to all branding-sensitive components: Logo, Footer, About page, Order invoices, Admin Sidebar, Admin Navbar, and Analytics page.

## Installation Instructions
Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- MySQL 8+

Backend setup
1. Configure database and secrets in `nexcartBackEnd\src\main\resources\application.properties`.
2. Run the backend:
```bash
cd nexcartBackEnd
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
Backend runs at `http://localhost:9090`.

Frontend setup
1. Configure API base URL in `NexCartFrontend\.env.local`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9090
```
2. Run the frontend:
```bash
cd NexCartFrontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5174`.

## Running the Application
1. Start MySQL and ensure the `nexcart` database is available.
2. Start the backend on port 9090.
3. Start the frontend on port 5174.
4. Open `http://localhost:5174` for customer login.
5. Open `http://localhost:5174/admin` for admin login.

Admin bootstrap credentials
- Username and password are defined in `application.properties` under `admin.bootstrap.*`.

## Environment Variables
